MANIFEST FOR JIRA XALANC-712

The XALAN, XALAN-C and XALAN-J web pages can be created relative to
the Windows directory into which you unzip these three files.
e
   bin-win32-20110902.zip
   build-xalan-docs-20110902.zip
   xdocs-xalan-docs-20110902.zip

These files can be extracted to any directory, but they are based
on the SVN directory tree of

   xalan/java/trunk/

With sources merged from

   xalan/c/trunk/xdocs/

The old Java StyleBook templates are not being used.  The web page
construction is built using command files and a new "stylebook.xslt"
XSLT transformation stylesheet.  The web pages are rendered by 
browsers using the new apache-xalan.css stylesheet.

THIS IS A SNAPSHOT OF MY XALAN DOCUMENTATION PROJECT TOOLKIT ON WINDOWS   

The new-format web pages for the following ASF XALAN web sites are
combined in build-xalan-docs-20110902.zip for your review.

   http://xalan.apache.org        -->  build/docs/xalan/*

   http://xml.apache.org/xalan-c  -->  build/docs/xalan/xalan-c/*

   http://xml.apache.org/xalan-j  -->  build/docs/xalan/xalan-j/*

The new-format sources are combined into a common source tree
in xdocs-xalan-docs-20110902.zip for your review.  There is no change in
source markup other than to fix DOCTYPE (DTD) validation.

   xdocs/style/dtd  ..  contains the edited StyleBook DTDs for XALAN-J

   xdocs/sources    --  contains the combined sources for the 3 sites.
                        (Only the StyleBook XML sources and scripts)

   xdocs/sources/make-all.bat  --  Windows script to create all web pages.

   http://xalan.apache.org     --> make-book-org.bat

   http://xml.apache.org/xalan-j   --> make-book-xalanj.bat

   http://xml.apache.org/xalan-j/design --> make-book-design.bat

   http://xml.apache.org/xalan-j/xsltc  --> make-book-xsltc.bat

   http://xml.apache.org/xalan-c   --> make-book-xalanc.bat

The <book> files and selected sources have been edited to convert
the URI "sbk:" to a proper relative path.

The file directories are those found in the SVN repository for XALAN-J
except as follows:

The top-level sources for XALANJ are now in: xdocs/sources/xalan-j

The top-level sources for XALANC are now in: xdocs/sources/xalan-c

XALAN Comman-Line Processor (Windows 32-bit)

   bin/xalan.exe

This is the Apache XALAN command-line interface as compiled with
the Current SVN of Xalan-C (1.11) and version 3.1.1 of Xerces-C

---------------------------
Sincerely,
Steven J. Hathaway 
(shathaway@apache.org)

P.S.  I have not yet changed the new proposed logos to add (TM).

The next minor change to the "stylebook.xslt" is to accommodate
the <group> child element of <book> as used by example for the
old Xerces-C web page.  This allows navigation grouping similar
to how they separate Xerces-C 2.8 and Xerces-C 3.1.1 distributions.
